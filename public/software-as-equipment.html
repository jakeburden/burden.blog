          I found myself making connections to how Heidegger&rsquo;s analysis of
          equipment fits in the software world.
        </p>

        <h2
          class="text-lg lg:text-2xl mt-8 mb-3"
          id="equipment-is-inconspicuous-unobtrusive-and-non-obstinate"

          equipment is inconspicuous, unobtrusive, and non-obstinate
        </h2>

        <p class="mb-2">Using a hammer.</p>

        <p class="mb-2">Driving a car.</p>

        <p class="mb-2">Drinking coffee from a mug.</p>

        <p class="mb-2">
          We don&rsquo;t need to carefully consider each movement of our arms.
          It tends to feel like a natural process, like moving across a room.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-2">
          Even as I&rsquo;m typing this, I&rsquo;m not pestering over each
          keystroke. I hardly think about my laptop as an object that is in
          front of me. However, if a key were to become stuck as a typed, then
          my laptop would become obvious to me.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-2">
          When tools work, they evolve from being objects to being equipment.
          When equipment breaks down, becomes inert, or becomes non-functional,
          it starts devolving down to being just an object again.
        </p>

        <h2
          class="text-lg lg:text-2xl mt-8 mb-3"
          id="software-evolves-into-being-equipment"
        >
          software evolves into being equipment
        </h2>

        <p class="mb-2">
          Software is interesting, in that it&rsquo;s not an object, yet it
          still becomes equipment. Our focus on software fades as we become
          accustomed to it&rsquo;s interface. If the software is <em>good</em>,
          we tend to direct our focus on the task itself. Of course, software
          can become obtrusive. If a request fails, a bug becomes apparent,
          it&rsquo;s slow to perform an operation, our focus shifts from the
          task we are set to work on, and back onto the software itself.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-2">
          I&rsquo;m unsure of what software metaphysically devolves into when it
          fails to be inconspicuous, unobtrusive, and non-obstinate. I
          don&rsquo;t think Heidegger was interested in the metaphysical aspect
          of object into equipment, but more on the authenticity of the
          equipment. Perhaps it&rsquo;s not that software simply becomes
          inauthentic when it breaks down, but that it is the inauthentic
          software that has a tendency to break down.

          mass production of software

        <p class="mb-2">
          From Heidegger&rsquo;s, <em>History of the Concept of Time</em>:
        </p>

        <blockquote class="text-gray-500 border-l border-gray-500 pl-4 my-4">
          <p class="mb-2">
            In simple craft conditions, every single work even has within it a
            reference to the particular prospective wearer and user. The work is
            as it were tailored to his body. Some goods are still custom-made
            and not mass-produced for the average &ldquo;cross-section.&rdquo;
            Mass-produced articles themselves do not lack reference, but it is
            quite generic; they have an indeterminacy, an arbitrariness, but
            they nevertheless have a reference to indeterminate others. What is
            of primary importance here is not the variety of modifications in
            content which arise, but the already given context of being from
            which they arise and which characterizes the presence of the work to
            be produced in concern.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="mb-2">
          My particular interest here is that software is very easily mass
          produced. It can be copied and distributed to such a high degree that
          we might was well consider it infinite.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-2">
          How then, do we prevent software from becoming generic, arbitrary, and
          lacking reference? Is that even a goal that we have with software, or
          are we aiming for accessibility by producing for the average
          cross-section? We bloat websites with analytics to see if our
          &ldquo;user flows&rdquo; are matching expectation and validate our
          decisions. I&rsquo;m not certain that this alone tells the whole
          story. Perhaps talking with the user, and having a conversation, would
          be more enlightening to their experience.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-2">
          The industry seems to default to making mass produced software.
          Subscription models where every one gets the same thing, with perhaps
          some personalization after collecting data. There is nothing bad about
          this of course, and Heidegger isn&rsquo;t suggesting that
          mass-produced equipment is bad either. Mass-production makes tools
          widely accessible.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-2">
          I&rsquo;m curious though, of what custom-made, hand-crafted software
          would offer.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-2">
          What would be your version of movie streaming, social networking, book
          reading, messaging? If you <em>make</em> software, do you always pull
          from the off-the-shelf-tools? What would be <em>your</em> version of a
          framework, a database, or a UI library?
        </p>

        <p class="mb-2">
          Standardization, consensus, protocol, and &ldquo;battle
          tested&rdquo;-ness, are indubitably useful for progress. I argue
          though, that we lean to far into favoring those attributes, and do not
          spend enough time exploring the other side. Building custom-made,
          non-standard, experimental software. Software that has a specific task
          is mind for a specific person. It might be just for you, or your
          friend, or your client. You might find that other people also like the
          theme of the software you&rsquo;ve created.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-2">
          The humanist aspect to software as equipment is that it is
          inconspicuous, unobtrusive, and non-obstinate for someone.
